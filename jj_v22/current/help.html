<h3>Features:</h3>
<hr style="width:50%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
<br>
- This program has a list of all known job posting webpages in New York State for:
<br><p class="negative-indent">- Counties, Cities, Towns, and Villages
<br>
- Public school districts
<br>
- Colleges and Universities</p>

<br>- Searches for any of the user-specified job titles
<br>
<br>- Limit the search to a geographic distance
<br>
<br>- Sort results by how likely they are to contain job postings
<br>
<br>- Fuzzy matching allows for slight differences in spelling to still match. Matches must be within two character edits and 90% similarity.
<p class="negative-indent">For example: "Correctional Officer" will match "Corrections Officer".
<br>
<br>Fuzzy matching may dramatically increase how long the search takes.
<br>Hover over a result to see its percent similarity.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!-- Tips section-->
<h3>Input Tips:</h3>
<hr style="width:50%; text-align:left; margin-left:0">
<br>
 - All user input is case-insensitive. Therefore, you don't need to worry about using uppercase or lowercase letters.
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - The user-specified job titles are called keywords. A keyword can contain spaces or any other ASCII printable characters.
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - Any text in the input field will be accepted as a keyword when the "Next" button is pressed. Therefore, you don't need to press the "Enter" button if only one keyword is being used.
<br>
<br>
<br>
 - This program will not find job postings if they are synonyms to your keyword.
<p class="negative-indent">For example:<br>
A keyword search using "corrections officer" would NOT match a job posting for a "prison guard".<br>
In this case you should input all synonyms at the job title page.</p>
<br>
 - Using a less specific keyword will help get more results.
<p class="negative-indent">For example:<br>
A keyword search using "correction" would match a job posting for a "Correctional Officer". However, you don't want to be too vague because it will yield many false positive results.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!-- Limitation section-->
<h3>Limitations:</h3>
<hr style="width:50%; text-align:left; margin-left:0">
<br>
- This program is not for browsing all available jobs. It is for finding job postings for specific job titles.
<br>
<br>
<br>- This program does not search other centralized job posting websites. Such as:
<br>
<br>&emsp;Local governments:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/jobs/index.page">NYC</a>
<br><p class='double-negative-indent'>School Districts:
<br>- <a href="https://www.applitrack.com/caboces/onlineapp/default.aspx?all=1">Applitrack</a>
<br>- <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/">NYC Schools</a>
<br>- <a href="https://www.pnwboces.org/olas/#!/jobs">Online Application System for K-12
Education</a>
<br>- <a href="https://monroe1.recruitfront.com/JobBoard">RecruitFront</a></p>
&emsp;Colleges:
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- <a href="https://cuny.jobs/#98">CUNY</a>
<br>&emsp;&emsp;- <a href="https://www.suny.edu/careers/employment/index.cfm?s=y">SUNY</a>
<br>
<br>
<br>I suggest you search these websites manually to find additional job postings.
